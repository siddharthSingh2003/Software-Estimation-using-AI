# Software Effort Estimation Using Machine Learning

## Project Description

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model designed to estimate software development effort. The project leverages multiple machine learning algorithms to provide accurate and reliable effort estimations, improving project planning and resource allocation.

## Key Features

- **Algorithms Used**: Generalized Linear Model, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and XGBoost stacking.
- **Datasets**: Public datasets including Cocomo81, China, DeSharnais, Kemerer, Maxwell, and Albrecht.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and R-squared.
- **Technologies**: Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy.
